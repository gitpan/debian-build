perl (5.003.07-10) unstable frozen; urgency=HIGH

  * SUID perl patch to fix buffer overrun that allows any user to get a
    suid-root shell.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Mon, 21 Apr 1997 20:50:21 -0700

perl (5.003.07-9) unstable frozen; urgency=medium

  * Applied patch from HJ Lu for libc6
  * Removed perl-base from dist for release into bo
  * This will be the last release that has /bin/perl as a link (or at all).

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Wed, 16 Apr 1997 01:02:07 -0700

perl (5.003.07-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * How'd that get in there?
    Somehow a static version of postinst crept into the dist such that it
    depended on 5.00320 and i386.  *embarrased*

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Sat, 8 Mar 1997 14:06:21 -0800

perl (5.003.07-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compile the perl library with -D_REENTRANT for LinuxThreads.  It's
    still dangerous and there are problems with MULTIPLICITY (which this
    isn't compiled with) as well.
  * Sent the output of the various rmdir -p's in postinst to /dev/null so
    that people don't see old gunk.
  * Included target to add a comment to the changelog so that an automatic
    package from untarring this in a new perl subversion works with the
    correct version.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Mon, 3 Mar 1997 01:35:20 -0800

perl (5.003.07-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed perl, perl-suid, and perl-debug to section interpreters.
    Changed perl-base to section base.
  * Changed rules to determine the perl version dynamically so that it
    doesn't have to be editted for each new version.
  * Rebuld and upload so that perl will just pre-depend on libc5.4 rather
    than libc5.4.17-1.  This and -5 were destined for stable and 5.4.17-1
    isn't available for that.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Fri, 17 Jan 1997 19:04:13 -0800

perl (5.003.07-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved config.over.MK to the debian directory so that all the files
    that I add are there.
  * Just ignore the mkdir on /usr/local as the easiest solution to the
    NFS-ro /usr/local problem.  Suggestion by Guy Maor <maor@ece.utexas.edu>.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Fri, 10 Jan 1997 02:13:22 -0800

perl (5.003.07-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed problem with suidperl.  It will actually run suid now.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Sun, 15 Dec 1996 23:56:59 -0800

perl (5.003.07-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add check to postinst to check for old perlconfig created include
    directories and removed them.
  * Made perlbase's Config.pm use the correct install paths
  * Made perl provide/replace/conflict with perlbase to replace it
    properly
  * No longer put libperl.a in suidperl since we not doing shared perl.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Thu, 12 Dec 1996 23:40:09 -0800

perl (5.003.07-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed Perl to provide io as well as conflict with it since it's been
    subsumed into the main perl distribution.
  * Applied patch from Nick to make use FileHandle; work transparently
    although is should be use IO::Handle (or other appropriate IO::)
  * Applied patch from Randy so that use sigtrap doesn't complain anymore.
  * Applied patch from Paul that changes use strict tie; into a warning.
  * Changed perl back to a static libperl
  * Developed and packaged a perl-base to go on the base-floppies.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Thu, 21 Nov 1996 04:13:51 -0800

perl (5.003.07-1) unstable; urgency=medium
  
  * added code to postinst/prerm that only creates the empty
    /usr/local/lib/site_perl directory if /usr/local/lib is writable by
    root (fixes Bug #5003)
  * Updated to dpkg standards version 2.1.1.0  (fixes Bugs #3874, 4709)
  * Pre-generated all the *.ph files that people will probably need.  The
    correct asm directory will have a symbolic link set during postinst.
    (fixes Bugs #4493, 4739, 1856, 3770, 3277, 3803, 3814, 1099, 3784,
     1201, 1170, 3908, 2405, 4717, 2184, 1411, 2440)
    I wonder if this is a record for the most number of bugs fixed by a
    change.
  * Changed debian.rules to generate a shared libperl for the main
    executable with a static suidperl and debugperl.  This should help
    Fast-CGI, nvi, and if folks are using the compiler.
  * Edited the copyright file to reflect current reality rather than
    bygone days (fixes Bug #2589)
  * Added Pre-depends: ldso to control file in case the user upgrades ldso
    at the same time they upgrade Perl. (fixes Bug #2589)
  * Made sure that all files in the examples directory
    (/usr/doc/perl/examples) were readable (fixes Bug #3995, 4615, 4734, 
    4870)
  * Added symbolic link /usr/doc/perl/examples to point to the examples
    directory. (fixes Bug #3997)  (this is obsoleted by new standards)

	  remove the tcsh once c-shell is provided by it.
	* Changed the suidperl from being a question in the postinst to
	  being it's own package.
	* Added perld (debugging perl) as a package.  Both of these are
	  dependent on the specific version of perl.  We'll see if this
	  causes a problem in upgrading.

	  got to do something about perlconfig

	  dependencies on the new names (libdb1 and libgdbm1)
	
Perl 5.002 Debian 3 Mon Dec 18 03:23:04 1995  Darren Stalder  <torin@daft.com>

	* Removed find lines in debian.rules binary install since

	* Changed Configure so that it actually listens when you tell it
	  what extensions to use for for man1 and man3.
	* Changed references to /usr/local and perl5.000 in the man pages
	* Changed references in scripts from /usr/local to /usr
	* Setup config.over file to fix-up config.sh to install into
	  debian-tmp/usr/* instead of trying to do it in sh.  The shared
	  libs weren't going in the right place.

	  from many different subdirectoris

	* Put quotes around $Config{archlibexp} in h2ph.PL to prevent -w
	  warnings.
	* Changed the various debian files to reflect the new status.
	* Changed the debian.rules to use elf as the primary development
	  platform with a.out being secondary.
	* Having problems with SDBM.

Perl 5.001 Debian 7 (5.001n) - ??-??-95 Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* UNRELEASED
* Longer Description field in control file.
* Changed Maintainer field to myself. This package should still be considered
  orphaned though.
* a.out version now does dynamic loading via libdld.

Perl 5.001 Debian 6 (5.001n) - 04-11-95 Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* Updated to 5.001n: big patch, small problems remain. 
* debian.rules now passes definitions to Configure, instead of running 
  Configure with a modified hints/linux.sh.
* Use a variable in debian.rules to test the binary format.
* With ELF, DB_File support is disabled (rather ad hoc).
* Use softlinks for suidperl and perl<version>.
* Added explicit Depends: elf-libc, which was implicit (via elf-libgdbm).

Perl 5.001 Debian 5 (5.001m) - 16-10-95 Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* ELF version has GDBM support; depends on elf-libgdbm

* Interim release, since perl appears to be orphaned.
* Updated to 5.001m.

Perl 5.001 Debian 3 - 5/9/95 Carl Streeter <streeter@cae.wisc.edu>
* Fixed Bug#219.  h2ph was making output which didn't work.
* put magic in the postinst to fix it.  This opens the can
* of worms whereby I fix all of h2ph's messups.  Ugh.

Perl 5.001 Debian 2 - 5/8/95 Carl Streeter <streeter@cae.wisc.edu>
* Added dialog.pl interface to dialog for Jim Robinson

Perl 5.001 Debian 1 - 3/1/95 Carl Streeter <streeter@cae.wisc.edu>

  (Just a copy of postinst, really)

* fixed bug in h2ph handling on subdirectories
* merged all of the unofficial patches from the perl5-porters mailing list.

Perl 5.000 Debian 4 - 3/1/95 Carl Streeter <streeter@cae.wisc.edu>
* h2ph now makes all useful headers.

Perl 5.000 Debian 3 - 2/28/95 Carl Streeter <streeter@cae.wisc.edu>
* called h2ph to make the handy perl headers.
* Put the example code and emacs modes in /usr/doc

Perl 5.000 Debian 2 - 2/27/95 Carl Streeter <streeter@cae.wisc.edu>
* generally fixed it up so it was useful for debian.
